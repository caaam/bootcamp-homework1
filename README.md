UNC Coding Bootcamp HTML Refactoring Project

For this project, I refactored the Horiseon homepage to better comply with modern web accessibility standards. In particular, alt tags and useful titles have been added to the page, along with an HTML structure that provides more semantic description and structure, as compared to the initial version. This was done in order to increase access availability by any and all users to the page. Ultimately, this page can now be accessed by users that employ technoliges such as screen readers, without degradation of user experience. I believe my version of the page is as widely usable as possible, and I have implemented these changes with no change to the page for existing end users, thus making the page a more useful solution for the company long term.
